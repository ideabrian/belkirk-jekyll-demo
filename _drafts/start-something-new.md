I want to try out a new technology, but I know it's going to go slow. Every 20-something person who's more technical than average is offering a solution to some problem. It's easier? The design is cleaner. It's hosted. It's a service.

Oh, and it's FREE to get started.

The tools are developing quickly. Commerce is exploding around the globe and it's never been easier to participate. But, how should you proceed when encountering a new product / service / technology?

Start with some basic questions.

Where am I going?

How will this help me?

How much time will it take to learn?

How long will it last?

What if it stops working a year from now? 

Do I have a backup plan?

You might not want to consider too deeply every time you run into something new. Exploring is fun for its own sake. Each new thing you learn feels interesting and somehow satisfying. Agreed.

At some point, it might get overwhelming. It's okay to take a break. If it's online, close down your tabs and close your eyes. Lay down even. Go for a walk. 

When you come back, get clear on what you'll accomplish and this session and then proceed. You can do this.
